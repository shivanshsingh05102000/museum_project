A majestic tree rises above the scene in the centre of the picture. Beyond, the land drops and rises again in the background where a church and other buildings are silhouetted against the lightly clouded sky. Two women with white bonnets can be seen walking along the road. Although this is a complex composition, Sisley has captured a sense of the calm freshness of an early summer day. The picture's surface is animated through the use of visible brushstrokes and the figures' shadows are painted in purple. Sisley was born in Paris of English parents and lived in France all his life. He struggled throughout his life to sell his work, although he was promoted by several important dealers, including Paul Durand-Ruel who handled this picture in 1892.",

However, it is unlikely that two non-matching wine flagons would have been given at the same time and so it is equally possible that the ewer and bowl were used in the ‘ablution' ritual in which the priest ceremonially washed his hands before celebrating communion. This ancient custom was revived in the early 1600s. The ewer, with its pear-shaped body and straight spout, is one of only five such ewers to be found in English churches.",

The hills in the distance, traditionally quarried for their gypsum deposits used in plaster of Paris, now form part of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont which was laid out in 1866-7.\nThere is a freshness in the observation of the morning light and a surety of touch in the use of near-black paint for the silhouetted figures by the Canal Saint-Martin.

To the 19th century spectator the scene would have suggested entertainingly dubious goings-on, such as smuggling. Thomas Barker was the most successful member of an artistic family which had settled in Bath in 1783. A local auctioneer, Charles Spackman, fostered his talent and paid for him to study in Italy from 1790 to 1793. This cavern scene, once known as 'The Bandits', was painted in Rome. Barker spent the rest of his career in Bath and although he was successful as a painter of portraits, rustic landscapes and genre scenes (everyday life), his popularity declined and he died in poverty.",

Kitchen scenes were also the subject of several paintings which Théodule Ribot, who was self-taught, had accepted for the Paris Salon in 1861. He achieved recognition and was presented with a special award at the Paris Exposition Universelle as well as the Légion d'honneur in 1878.",

The training of young painters in France at that time stressed the importance of such an 'étude', a rapidly painted oil study showing a fluidity of brushwork not seen in the finished work. But studies of this type were not regarded as works of art in their own right until much later in the 19th century. Many of Corot's small oil studies, including this one, remained in his studio until his death. The stamp of his posthumous sale can be seen on the bottom left.",

This painting originally belonged to the art dealer Margraf & Co, a company owned by the Jewish couple Rosa and Jakob Oppenheimer. The picture later came into the possession of the Jewish chemical engineer Leopold Moller. Moller fled from the Nazi regime to England in 1939 and managed to bring the Renoir and two other paintings with him - unframed, in his suitcase, convincing customs that they were not original works of art.",

Here, looking out towards the sea and beyond the vast expanse of sand in the foreground we see small figures of holiday-makers in their fashionable clothes and a number of beach huts.

The Virgin kneels before her child, and Joseph is shown as an elderly man praying in the background. A group of three angels has been included at the top of the composition. The colours in this image are jewel-like and the landscape is very finely painted. The image reflects the pioneering achievement by Flemish artists in the technique of oil painting which began to replace tempera painting across Europe. As in most images at the time, the stable, which appears as a grand but ruined building, forms a visual reference to the Temple of King Solomon in the Old Testament. This re-interpretation of the architecture was understood by believers to show the renewal of the old bond between God and the people through Christ.",

Striving to achieve recognition and success at the Paris Salon, Thomas Couture produced a number of large, complex compositions in the grand tradition. By contrast, this more intimate painting demonstrates the more spontaneous side of his nature. It is one of a number of studies which Couture made of the strolling Italian players who passed by his home at Villiers-le-Bel in 1877. Couture was a popular and influential teacher in Paris and encouraged his pupils to retain the qualities of the sketch, such as pure colour and fresh brushwork, in their finished paintings. Among his pupils were Edouard Manet, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, and several American artists.",

Rapidly, the Dutch Republic became one of Europe?s leading maritime nations with a global trading network. Naturally, the seascape was a popular genre in Dutch art, often suggesting a symbolic meaning behind the realism of the waves and sky. Like many of Willem van de Velde's atmospheric scenes of calm seas with shipping, this painting probably dates from the 1650s when the artist was still in his twenties and living in Amsterdam. Van de Velde's marine paintings were particularly prized and influential in England where the artist lived from about 1672.",

Eugène Boudin probably painted this still life just a few years after he gave up his stationery business and went to Paris to train as an artist. The composition and subject matter - a table laden with fruit, nuts, glassware, and oysters on a platter - demonstrate Boudin's study of seventeenth century Dutch still-life paintings. On the other hand, his relatively free handling of the paint shows his stylistic affinity with the contemporary Barbizon School painters.",

The almost monochromatic grey palette and soft focus contribute to the naturalistic recreation of light, space and colour.\nEugène Carrière's early work was influenced by Rubens and Velazquez but he later gave up the use of colour. The monochrome works of his final period were greatly admired by the sculptor Rodin who recognised Carrière's mastery of tone in the way that he modelled forms without the distraction of colour.",

The scene shows neither a specific location nor a particular point of interest, yet it conveys a sense of monumentality. In contrast to the Impressionists, who were to use white canvases, Courbet worked in the traditional manner upon a dark ground which here intensifies the melancholy mood. He explained: “nature, without the sun, is also dark and black. I do as the light does, I illuminate the parts that project, and the picture is done”. The realist painter Courbet is best known for his paintings of contemporary life.",

They are predominantly landscapes, painted directly onto cigar-box lids. Such lids were easy to carry and the red-brown colour of the wood provided a warm ground ideally suited to landscape subjects. In his paintings Seurat sought ‘an optical formula' by which to discipline his work. Here he has tentatively begun to use the theory of complementary colours. In the foreground of the field with its fruit trees and low buildings beyond, touches of blue are juxtaposed with their complementary colour, a deep orange. This gives a far more vibrant and luminous effect than could have been achieved by the artist mixing his colours on the palette. The clouds over the horizon take up a lighter orange glow.",

This may explain Garstin’s choice of a radical composition and perspective. In 1884 he wrote of Edouard Manet: 'He lets in light and air. Pictures like his later ones amongst the brown bitumen canvas of the average exhibition seem like patches of sunlight on a prison wall'.",

Two ships frame the composition on either side. This is not an illustration of a well-known literary, mythological or religious narrative. Although the brushstrokes are bold and the palette is light and atmospheric, Redon also clearly rejected the Impressionists' style and subject matter. He regarded their work as only an extreme form of naturalism and considered them to be slaves of the visual world. His own pictorial world was mystical and imaginative and for almost twenty years he even rejected colour and created dreamlike, symbolist images in charcoal and monochrome prints. In his later years he returned to a celebratory use of colour as can be seen in this work.",

Vuillard's harmonious colour scheme was achieved by his choice of materials. The picture was painted directly onto unprimed cardboard, its warm mid-tone often left untouched by any pigment. The surface of the cardboard is visible in all areas of the painting, particularly in the sofa and the floor.",

Pocock managed to compose what must have been a chaotic scene into one in which the viewer can clearly read the action. Nicholas Pocock enjoyed a successful career as an artist in Bristol and then London, carving out a niche for himself as a painter of ships and sea battles. He admired the 17th century Dutch marine painter Willem Van de Velde, and the President of the Royal Academy Sir Joshua Reynolds encouraged him to seek out other artists, especially Claude-Joseph Vernet. Pocock learnt how to make sophisticated but accurate compositions from Vernet's ability to unite landscape with nautical painting.",

However, the ruinous round tower, although familiar in Italian landscapes, is actually Dolbadarn Castle, seen as it stands on its crag at the foot of Snowdon in North Wales. Richard Wilson was the first British-born artist to make a full-time career as a landscape painter and was encouraged to persevere by the French painter Claude-Joseph Vernet. This is one of a set of four classical landscapes painted for Henry Blundell of Ince Hall, Lancashire; the others remain at the Hall.

The layered surface of Sikander's drawing stages a confrontation between 'East' and West': the effect is a visual break with the colonial culture represented by Sikander's Company Man.",

The perspective is focussed on a ship in the middle distance, thereby closing off the background beyond and keeping the picture space narrow. Boudin was born near the harbour at Le Havre on the Normandy coast and this area was the inspiration for most of his atmospheric art. He had the gift of communicating his enthusiasm for working direct from nature to other artists and painted with Courbet, Whistler and the young Monet and his influence on the latter was crucial.",

In this painting it stands out against the luminous sky and serves as a backdrop to the busy traffic of boats going about their business on the main waterway through the city. This picture is also highly significant as a key work by Michele Marieschi, an important Venetian vedutista, whose monogram appears on one of the barrels to the right.

Along a rough path leading into the distance a number of farmhouses can be seen, with an elevated walled kitchen garden next to the thatched building in the left foreground. Abandoning the conventions of a neo-classically composed and ‘improved' landscape, in this painting shrubs, rocks and trees to the right render the uneven terrain rugged and impenetrable. A number of tiny chickens and the small figures of local people add life to the scene. Painted in clear blocks of colour and engaged in everyday activity, they are not intended as a display of folkloristic detail. The painter has inscribed the scene 'Avallon' in the bottom right corner, although this landscape does not show the historic French town itself.",

Walter Sickert visited Venice four times between 1895 and 1904. There are at least six other versions of this composition and it has been suggested that he had seen Monet's famous series of the façade of Rouen Cathedral, in Paris, while traveling to Venice for the first time. Monet had famously depicted the cathedral in changing light settings, resulting in a different colour range in each canvas.",

Tempera is fast-drying and was applied quickly in parallel strokes with any under-colour showing between the lines, as in the robe of the angel on the right. The paint was laid on a brilliant white absorbent ground of gesso made largely from gypsum. Under-drawing was often incised or, as here, painted on. Where the red has faded from St John the Baptist's robe (on the right) the fluent but precise drawing is very obvious. The areas to be covered in gold leaf were first painted with a red clay base, which is now quite visible, and decorative patterns for the haloes were punched after the gilding. Powdered gold patterns were also applied to the borders of robes and, here, also to the Virgin's under-dress. The gold has been rubbed away but the raised mordant pattern can still be seen.",

The artist and his uncle Giovanni Antonio Canal, commonly called Canaletto, collected motifs from the atmospheric Lagoon on a trip to Padua in 1741. This imaginary or capriccio painting and the Tower of Malghera are in fact based on compositions by Canaletto, but the young artist was soon to lead his own successful career as court painter in Dresden, Vienna and Warsaw.",

Lady Honywood was the eldest daughter of William Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon and the portrait was probably painted as a gift to her family after she had settled with her husband Sir John Honywood in Kent. The portrait is noted in 1784 in Sir Joshua Reynolds's pocket book where he would make appointments for sittings. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy that year, where it was acclaimed by the art critics of the day. Reynolds is at his most subtle in this intimate study of a mother and daughter on a grand scale. He has cleverly contrasted the ruddiness of the child's complexion and shiny hair with her mother's rouged cheeks and powdered hair. The pose is unusual, showing the mother's tender support for her child as she takes tentative steps while looking confidently back at the viewer",

In 1746 the French ambassador to the Vatican Frédéric-Jérôme de la Rochefoucauld de Roye commissioned Vernet to paint this scene and its pendant, contrasting evening storm and morning calm. The second painting is now in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The 'missing lower corners of the composition are an original feature in both paintings, here covered with a slip frame.

In 1793 Antoine-Jean Gros left France for Italy, where he spent the next eight years. The portraits of Catherine Bruguière and her husband, François, number among many works which Gros painted in Genoa. In the pendant, François, ship owner and president of the French chamber of commerce in Genoa, is presented as a supporter of revolutionary France. Around the time he painted these portraits, Gros met Josephine Bonaparte in Genoa, an auspicious meeting which led to his later acquaintance with Napoleon and his establishment as a leading artist.",

The sky and sea were completed in vigorous strokes of thick paint (impasto). He preferred pure colour, and frequently contrasted complementary colours, as here with blue and orange.

Moreau's subjects were exclusively taken from classical mythology or the bible. He painted with a sumptuous richness; his larger works have elaborately encrusted surfaces built-up from many layers of pigment. The poetry and imaginative power of his work particularly appealed to men of letters like the novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans.

In front of a tall tree in the background Jeanne Gonzalès, who often modelled for her sister, is seated on a donkey in a fashionable dress. She gazes past the viewer, while Henri Guérard, the artist's husband, looks on. After Eva's sudden death aged only thirty-four, Jeanne and Henri married. The unfinished painting was found in the artist's studio after her death, and the area around the man's jacket is unresolved. It clearly shows the influence of Edouard Manet, who became Eva Gonzales' teacher after she worked as a model for him. Donkey Ride' is the only work by Gonzalès, who is one of a number of female Impressionists, in a public collection in Great Britain.",
